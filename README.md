This project uses an CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) using PyTorch to recognize the Rock, Paper and Scissor hand gesture.
## Usage:
### capture_images.py
```
$ ./capture_images.py <label_name> <num_samples>
# label_name: The label e.g. rock, paper, scissor.
# num_samples: How many images will be stored.
```
